I wonder how could I normally give up myself in the past two years. More exactly is that my values had changed in the past two years. Some one ever said that we should have confidence unconditionally. Two years ago I am a girl who believed in this sentence and have unconditional confidence everyday. But something happened to me in the past two years which changed my values. I have doubt in myself. I even have doubt in the value of myself in the past two years. I thought that I am too confident in the past. So in the past two years I always suppressed my emotion and life become gray. But five months ago I watched the Korean TV series The Heirs unintentionally, although the story is not special I am attracted by the acting skills of the actor Lee Minho and watch all his TV series and become his fans. Everyday when I have time I will search the internet to see if there are newly news about him. So it become one of my fun in my spare time to  search his information. So I have no chance to think of the unhappy things in my spare time. Then life seems very smooth in the following days, work, travelling, shopping, film, food, and Lee Minho, that's all my life in the past five months. Last night I saw the diary I ever wrote, and feel sorry to myself, how could I be so  bad to myself in the past two years. And a thought come to my mind that is we should cherish ourselves as a girl, and live a happy life.
