s was the third time the big toe of my right foot has been wounded. The first was by kicking son and I suffered pain for several days. The second was by kicking a student, which crippled me for a few days. And the third happened yesterday, also by kicking a student. Every time I acted rashly in the anger of the moment. This time the injury seems to be the worst for the swelling toe with extravasated blood makes me feel painful to wear any shoe except the loose slipper. I had to invent an excuse to ask for a day's leave today.
