Solitude — if analysed in its Chinese characters, this word would mean "the king" in Gu, and "the one and only" in Du. As the king who's the one and only, he must accept eternally the experience of solitude. He needs no one to identify with him, not to mention that on him no compassion is taken. The king could absolutely advance alone in a rather undisturbed atmosphere. 

      Solitude does not emerge from depression or disappointment in love, since such feelings are merely inanity and loneliness; they never deserve to be called solitude. Solitude is a kind of personal state, a state of integrate harmony. As long as it is authentic, it is noble and honorable.

      All that are in solitude are great minds. When one is in such a solitary state, he faces his true self, and it's in this process that all human thoughts are generated. He makes himself quiet whatever environment he is in; he always finds his own joy — he does, definitely, if only he's the one in solitude.
