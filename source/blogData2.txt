It was supposed to be a fine day, with good weather and half day off, till this morning, I found out on my way to work that my food card had been lost, which I just recharged 200 RMB a few days ago. I am pretty depressed, especially when thinking of the lost of both my wallet and iphone not long before the spring festival. I admit that I am never a very careful person, but I never lost things in such high frequency. Since it already happened, I can only draw the lesson, and try my best to prevent next time. I wonder if everyone's love life is so distracting as mine. Generally speaking, when someone is in love, he will pay more attention to his partner, instead of the environment and surrounded situation, thus accident often fall on lovers. The accident happened on me, when my wallet and iphone were stolen, or when my food card lost, are partly due to my focusing too much on my boyfriend, trying to please him, and therefore neglecting the thief behind my back and his hand reaching my iphone. So I'm confused, is my boyfriend occupying my too much attention, or it's just I'm too careless. Shall I love my boyfriend less?
