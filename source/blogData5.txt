 feel great stress after meet you,i don't know how to express this feeling,most of time i feel we are happy when we stay together or talking ,but you may don't know ,sometimes i just don't want to speak a word with you ,i don't know  why i think like this ,i am afraid i will lost you or i just don't want to together with you,  when we talk  something about future such as marry and baby ,i feel great stress ,Great mental stress make me feel uncomfortable ,i can't do my job perfect .i have no confidence to our relationship,most of time ,i think a man are always selfishness,they will  never love you so much as they said ,i am afraid love ,marriage....
     today , i feel backache , it make me so sad ,i always think what should i do if i got a serious disease? Dear god ,please bless me ,i need health and relax.
