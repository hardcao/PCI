Hi everyone, how are youÔºÅIt is so long time, about five months for me not to see you guys. Miss you very much. In the past months, i am so busy that have no time to review my space in the DioEnglish. From this day, I come back, hope we can have a good communication, everything we can talk about, job, life, sport, love, and so on. 
Today, one thing we have to say, that the disapprared plane from Malaysia to China beijing is still not found, let us pray, wish our compatriot can come back, wish our goverment can supply more help and support.
