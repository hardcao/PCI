The foreign teachers in our university are living in the apartments of the 26th building, where we students can access on every Tuesday night for talking with each other in English. It's just like a English corner but we call it OpenHouse because of foreign teacher living there.

This Tuesday Sherry, one hostess of OpenHouses, give us a pile of pictures and ask us to choose one of them. What we need to do is to discribe the contents of the picture and share what you are think about it or youself when saw it.

My first picture is a Beijing map with a compass on it. It reminds me of a trip to Beijing with my Dad and Grandma about 20 years ago. Though I was only about 3 years old at that time, that journey gave me a strong impression. Till date, I stil remember the situation that I ran on the Great Wall as fast as wind. Now Beijing has another meaning to me. For some reanson, my mother didn't go to Beijing with us. 20 years fly away. She is growing older and older. I hope to accompany with her to go to Beijing, where she always says she'd like to go.

The second picture is about two old and dirty buckets with some concrete inside. They may belong to a constructon worker. I make up a little story that a man works as a buider in a big city. He comes from a remote countryside where his wife and children live there.Only in Spring Festival every year can he go back to get together with families.
