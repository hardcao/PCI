This dendrogram not only uses connections to show which items ended up in each cluster, it also uses the distance to show how far apart the items were. The AB cluster is a lot closer to the individual A and B items than the DE cluster is to the individual D and E items. Rendering the graph this way can help you determine how similar the items within a cluster are, which could be interpreted as the tightness of the cluster.
