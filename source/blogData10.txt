Kurt Chew-Een Lee(吕超然), the first US Marine Corps officer of Chinese descent, died on March 3, 2014. He earned bravery medals in the Korean War and was widely regarded as a Chinese American hero.

In China, however, it is hard to consider him to be a hero. The reason is simple: He killed many Chinese Volunteer Army soldiers in the Korean War. Maybe you would say it is understandable, he was a serviceman, after all. In an intense battle, if I don't kill you, then you will kill me. It's an unavoidable thing. What was unusual about him is that he identified himself as Chinese in Mandarin in combats, especially during the night. He would shout, "I'm Chinese." to deceive and confuse the Volunteer Army soldiers, and then launched an attack suddenly.

A war hero can be a great murderer depending on how you look at it. The only way to avoid tragedy of this kind is to prevent wars from happening. The ones who suffer the most are invariably the common people.
