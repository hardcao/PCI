The disappearance of the Kuala Lumpurâ€”Beijing passenger plane came as a sad shock to the families of the passengers on board. But to others, it is just an item of news that can be talked about in a light vein. The wealthy travelers might not have known that a disaster was in store for them after enjoying an intoxicating exotic trip. As for the rank and file, they cannot afford the expensive tour and have no wish to do so. But they are safe from any danger which is always hidden behind the scenes of intoxication. Never envy the upper classes, they have their own sadness, too. I would rather sympathize the common people who lost their lives in accidents or disasters than deeply deplore the death of extravagant people as in this case.
