Lots of people choose to quit job because of low salary. Maybe that’s not only low salary, but also terrible working environment. I strong believe that not satisfied with the current salary is the true reason. Try to find an interesting job and a good pay was so difficult. For me, I am not so satisfied with my job. Because I did totally same tasks every day, Day after day and year after year, no changing no challenging, just repeat almost same things. Occasionally, I feel extremely irritable. Even I don’t know why I have such feeling. I should to consider all kinds of problems in the life as the growth of the age. It seems to be far from my dreams more and more. If I want to seize them It becomes more difficult.
