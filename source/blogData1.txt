it's my first time be here. it is a great pity that until now i found out such a wonderful place.
although i am a Ph.D candidates in an excellent university in China,  my English is poor. i am shamed for this. 
recently, i am applying for an exchange programme that sponsored by the university which aimes to encourage Ph.D student to study abroad. i prepared my CV and application letter by myself, and then i sent it to one of my teachers back from Australia lately for advice. 
today in the morning, i have received a reply. my teacher have modified my CV and application letter a lot, making them much graceful. until now, i realize that my English is so poor that what i have written is that bad and  stuffy, just as my dairy here.
i greatly hope that my english will be better.
i sincerely hope my speaking and writting to be native-like.
i wish i could also write some graceful article someday in the future
