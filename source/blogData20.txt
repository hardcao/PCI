The incident of the lost Malaysia plane tells us: You never know which day is the last of your life. You may well ask yourself whether you live your each and every minute relaxed amd content or with regrets and misgivings? Actually nothing is truly important in life except life and death. 

Relish the moment! Do what you like to do and eat what you desire to eat. Climb more mountains and see more of the world. Work hard while working and play hard while playing. Put down the burden on your mind. Only when you let go can you move forward and travel light in life. 

You have not much to squander. It would be a fortunate thing if you can reach the age of 80. Altogether we have about 30 thousand days in our whole life. You can easily calculate how many days you stil have in this world. Therefore, treat yourself nicely; treasure each moment and love the people around you, especially your family.
