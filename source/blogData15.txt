Once I was to retire for the night when a siren began to blare at the foot of our apartment building. The sound was so loud and near that I first thought it  came from my computer. Later I concluded that it must be made by a car parked below. The blare lasted annoyingly for several minutes. Last night the siren made the same noise again. No one seemed to respond to it, which was left to screech on and on. Towards dawn this morning, I was woken up completely by the siren. It was for the prevention of theft that the siren was installed in the car. But the owner of the car was too inconsiderate  to disturb the quiet of the inhabitants here. The application of such a noisy siren must be banned in time, or if the large number of other car owners did the same, the dwellers nearby wouldn't have a peaceful time thereafter.
