facing too much death these days, i am felling blue. life is fragile, you do not know what time  when they will  leave you, so treat our family and friends friendly. big tree, i think i was naughtyï¼Œoften quarrel with you just because of little things. we have less time to stay together because we are in different places. so i would treasure the time and do some meaningful things but not to hurt you. big tree, you always forgive my shortcomings, but i do not well. i would get angry if you do something wrong, i remember you said that i lack of tolerance for you. i want to say sorry to you , i will convergence  of my temper.in my opinion, i thought that my big tree will do everything well and won't make faults. it is my fault, your image is perfect , so i do not allow you to make faults. but you are an ordinary person...my ideal is too sample. i will be better in the future.
