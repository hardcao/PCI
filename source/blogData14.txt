Maybe all of us had this experience that colleague leave from the company,  whatever the reasons, we will feel sad, but sometimes there is just one opportunity between you and your competitor, what is your choice, maybe you work hard and there is no one had over time than yours more, or you got big benifit for company and hit the target, all of this make you success, but we don't hope other people leave. Do you think so?
