The name Ai Wen（艾雯，a.k.a.Xiong Kun-chen 熊昆珍), the late Taiwan female writer, is familiar to me. Reading her essays is a joy. Her profile on  Baidu Baike and other baike entries tell me she died of heart attack on 2000 at the age of 71. Not long ago I chanced upon an interview of her entitled “Ai Wen: a Bow Across the (Taiwan) Straits”on on-line “Cultural Suzhou”, a repost from Suzhou Daily. The interview was dated Jan.9,2009!  Repeated searches on other web entries show that she died in 2009，surviving nine years more!
 
If web information can be wrong, especially when it lacks updating in time, the on-line software is also unreliable. I have been reading Samuel Pepys’s “Diary”, and am shocked by his description of the “Great Fire of London”. The fire broke out on Lord’s Day(Sunday), September 2,1666. I checked the date on the Perpetual Calendar. It tells me that September 2,1666 is Thursday. Is it Pepys’s slip of pen? If so, can Encyclopedia Britannica be wrong as well? If not, my perpetual calendar needs fine tuning!
 
On-line translation has a bad reputation of turning out awkward sentences and, most often, of not knowing what it says. Moreover, it can also be misleading. My recent experience of translating the academic paper “Coastal Zone Management” confirm this assumption once more. As an example, see this sentence:“However, the characteristics of water in an outflow layer are not constant over time.”If you are interested, try its on-line translation, either iCIBA, or Google, or others. What will you find? You will find that the translated meaning in Chinese is the other way round!
